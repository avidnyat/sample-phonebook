# sample-phonebook 

// used composer

This is sample application for Real Strategic Inc.

Following is the github link to clone from git

https://github.com/avidnyat/sample-phonebook.git

This project has two parts frontend and backend.

Backend is server side PHP using silex micro framework

Frontend is client side using Angularjs, Grunt , bower and yeoman.

//Backend side installation

after cloning use php composer.phar install 

import db using phone_book.sql

change db configuration in file app/config/config.php

// frontend side installation

Pls note without below command also application will work as I have deployed js files in php project setup

go to web folder
execute command: grunt build 

go to your url : http://localhost 

And that's it Application should load up.

Please use username : admin and password: admin to access application

Thanks
